# WebXR Testing API
To ensure that WebXR Device API and related APIs work cross-platform, we will develop [Web Platform Tests](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests). 
In order to enable these tests, we define a common API to simulate backend functionality. 
This repo contains the development and discussion for that API.
